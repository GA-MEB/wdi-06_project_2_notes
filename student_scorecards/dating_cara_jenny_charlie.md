                                PLANNING
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 1 - Planning (observations made on day 1)
#### Specification
  *Did the studentS put together a project summary? User stories? Wireframes? Did they map out their model relationships?*
  > Notes: YES. Absolutely, lot of planning up front on relationships, extensive materials, whiteboarded relationships, models and attributes. Lot of planning.
  > Score: 5

#### Solution Architecture
*Does the student's planned solution make sense for this problem? Have they chosen reasonable models and model relationships?*
> Notes: They have locations (matches based on locations). The relationships are simpler, but definitely make sense as far as planning the models and backend.
> Score: 4

#### Team Organization (Project 2 Only)
*Was a plan set in place for effective team communication and collaboration during the project?*
> Notes: There was a plan for work and checkins. **Not sure the initial plan was feasible in the alotted timeline, which might have caused some friction within the team.** They planned a schedule for the work, but did not necessarily plan team culture/communication/checkin.
> Score: 3


#### Collaboration (Project 2 Only)
  *Did the student work well with others during the planning process?*
  > Notes: Impressed with effort all members put into planning process.
  > Score: 4

                                EXECUTION
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 2 - Execution (observations made during project work time)
#### Version Control
*Is the student using version control effectively? Are they making regular commits, with clear commit messages? Are they avoiding making commits directly to their master branch?*
> Notes: # commits: decent. Could do more, but average. #commits straight to master branch/repo: more than I'd like to see. Reasonable commit messages with clear indications on what work was done. Would like to see more commits from Charlie on the back end api.
> Score: 3


#### Testing
*Is the student writing acceptance tests before they build new features? Are unit tests being written to test standalone components? Are the tests written correctly?*
> Notes: Decent amount of request specs for basic crud actions, enough to make Jason feel good about it.
> Score: 3


#### Independence
*Are the students effectively answering their own questions and resolving their own issues?*
> Notes: On a technical front, they're pushing themselves to the edge of their knowledge and then approaching instructors for help.
> Score: technical: 4

#### Collaboration (Project 2 Only)
*Is the student working effectively with others in their group? Are they pulling their weight vis-a-vis the group?*
> Notes: Interpersonal relationships were a challenge for this team and communication broke down to the point instructors felt it necessary to intervene. Students didn't feel comfortable resolving their own interpersonal issues, they didn't work as a team to solve their own problems. Jenny shutdown and refused to communicate (passive aggressiveness), while Cara shutdown out of fear of Jenny. 
> Score: 1

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

## 3 - Finished Product (observations made during and after presentation)
#### Presentation Score:
*Is the student's presentation clear? Does it effectively explain the purpose for the application and how it is used? Does the student effectively defend the decisions that have been made?*
> Notes:
> Score:


#### Functionality Score:
*Does the application work when it is demonstrated? How rubust is it?*
> Notes:
> Score:


#### Meets Project-Specific Requirements Score:
*Has the student met any special requirements for this particular project? (e.g. must be deployed to Heroku, must incorporate an external API)*
> Notes:
> Score:


#### Code - Structure Score:
*Does the code follow good design guidelines like SRP and DRY? Are methods/functions small and modular? Is there code smell?*
> Notes:
> Score:


#### Code - Syntax & Formatting Score:
*Is the code clear and readable? Does it use good naming conventions? Is the level of commenting appropriate, too sparse, or excessive?*
> Notes:
> Score:


#### Collaboration (Project 2 Only) Score:
*Has the student contributed meaningfully to the success of the group?*
> Notes:
> Score:
