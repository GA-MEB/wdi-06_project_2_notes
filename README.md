## WDI PROJECT TEMPLATE

Scoring Examples

##Planning
Observed during the first day or so of the project.
### Project Scope / Complexity
#### "Is the target too ambitious? Too easy? Will the student need to stretch themself in order to complete it?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 | The student must do some independent research and learning in order to complete the project in time; however, it's not an impossible task, given their current skill level. |
| 4 | Will require a fair amount of work to complete, but is doable in the time allowed (without outside research). |
| 3 | Fairly easy to complete in the time allowed. |
| 2 | Unambitious, and does not stretch at all beyond what's been explicitly covered in class - should only take a day or two to complete. <br> <br> OR <br><br> Very ambitious, and would probably take the student more than a week to complete. |
| 1 | Scope is totally mismatched for the project, to the degree where it implies a fundamental lack of understanding. |

###  Specification
#### "Did the student put together a project summary? User stories? Wireframes? Did they map out their model relationships?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Little to no planning materials produced. A project summary outlining what the project will do  2, + a model relationship diagram, some wireframes, or basic user stories. (but not all three)  Clear documentation, including user stories, model relationships, and wireframes for mutliple pages.  4, + detailed specs that readily lend themselves to becoming tests.
###  Solution Architecture
####  "Does the student's planned solution make sense for this problem? Have they chosen reasonable models and model relationships?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Student's solution will probably not work.  Solution might work, but is a pretty clear departure from best practices. Solution, while not best practice, is reasonable. Solution is in line with best practices for a problem of this type.  Solution demonstrates a clever and innovative way to solve the problem.
###  Team Organization (Project 2 Only)
####  "Was a plan set in place for effective team communication and collaboration during the project?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Team is disorganized and has no plan on how to proceed. Team has a very sketchy plan for how they will break up work. Team lays out a plan for who is responsible for what aspects of the project, when they expect to get things done, and how they will stay in communication.  3, + a plan for how the team will use version control.  4, + plans for a sophisticated branching structure, with branches for development, production, and individual features.
## EXECUTION (observed during project work time)
### Version Control
#### "Is the student using version control effectively? Are they making regular commits, with clear commit messages? Are they avoiding making commits directly to their master branch?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Few to no commits on GitHub.  Student is making irregular commits and pushing them to GitHub; however, commits are either way too big or way too small. Git workflow is generally poor. Commits are regular, but may still be too large or too small. Commit messages are not as clear as they might be.  Consistent, well-sized commits with appropriate and descriptive commit messages.  4, + use of branching in line with best practices.
### Testing
#### "Is the student writing acceptance tests before they build new features? Are unit tests being written to test standalone components?  Are the tests written correctly?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |
" No tests present. Very limited testing present. Models are unit tested  3, + outside-in acceptance tests. 100% test coverage.
### Independence
#### "Is the student effectively answering their own questions and resolving their own issues?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Student is unable to proceed on their own without an instructor or TA present.  Student is heavily reliant on guidance and assistance from the instructional team. Significant amounts of the project's code may have been written or heavily edited by instructors.  Student relies regularly on input and assistance from instructors, but is able to proceed on their own. Very little code, if any, written by instructors. Student needs minimal assistance and guidance from instructors, but checks in regularly just to make sure that they're on track.  4, + is able to assist and guide other students with their projects.

### Collaboration (Project 2 Only)
#### Is the student working effectively with others in their group?  Student does not work well with others, and negatively impacts the group dynamic. Student accomplishes assigned tasks, but is largely disconnected from the team. Student accomplishes assigned tasks and communicates adequately with the team regarding progress and group efforts. Student is a valuable and productive team member, communicating effectively and making significant contributions to group efforts.  Student is an exemplary team member and a driving force behind the group's progress.

## FINISHED PRODUCT  (observed during & after the presentation)
###  Presentation
####  "Is the student's presentation clear? Does it effectively explain the purpose for the application and how it is used? Does the student effectively defend the decisions that have been made?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Student is clearly unprepared for the presentation, and does not attempt to defend the decisions they've made. Little is shown of the finished product. Presentation describes some features, but is vague and doesn't really demonstrate what the app can do. Hiccups are disruptive; the student is spending more time talking about why things aren't working rather than showing off what does work (and what *will* work, with sufficient time and effort).  Presentation shows and describes features, but student spends too much time (a) talking about the build process, or (b) diving into minor features that don't need demonstration, and loses focus. If there are hiccups, the student may focus on apologizing for what going wrong instead of showing off what works. Presentation demonstrates the features of the app without diving too deeply; its focus is more "what this does" than "what I did". Adequately defends decisions made. 4, + presentation is compelling.
###  Functionality
####  "Does the application work when it is demonstrated? How robust is it?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" App is totally non-functional during the presentation.  App opens, but links may be broken and core functions may not work correctly. App opens, and core functions work, but there are still bugs and hangups. App works correctly under normal conditions, and can handle some unusual inputs.  4, + app is robust and can handle a malicious user.
###  Meets Project-Specific Requirements
####  "Has the student met any special requirements for this particular project? (e.g. must be deployed to Heroku, must incorporate an external API)
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Does not meet any project-specific requirements.  Somewhat meets project-specific requirements. Mostly meets project-specific requirements. Meets all project-specific requirements.  4, + goes beyond requirements to implement additional features.
###  Code - Syntax and Formatting
####  "Is the code clear and readable? Does it use good naming conventions? Is the level of commenting appropriate, too sparse, or excessive?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Code has significant syntax errors that prevent it from functioning.  Code is scattered and indentation is inconsistent. Naming of variables, functions, and objects is unhelpful or even misleading. Inapropriate levels of commenting.  Indentation and whitespace is OK, but naming is unclear. Comments are over-long.
###  Code - Structure
####  "Does the code (apart from templated boilerplate) generally follow good design guidelines like SRP and DRY? Are methods/functions small and modular? Is there code smell?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |

" Spaghetti code. The program's control flow is totally discombobulated.  Highly duplicative, with lots of 'voodoo code'; methods/functions are very large. Little to no 'voodoo code' present, but code is still somewhat duplicative (and/or functions and methods could be a lot smaller)  While not perfect, code is reasonably non-duplicative and modular.  Code is elegant, modular, and (where possible) devoid of side effects.
###  Group Contribution (Project 2 Only)
####  "Has the student contributed meaningfully to the success of the group?
| Score | Example |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| 5 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 3 |  |
| 2 |  |
| 1 |  |


" Student's participation in the project is minimal, with almost no code contributions. Student participates in the project, but code contributions are light/superficial.  Student's participation in the project is non-trivial, but below the bar set by their teammates.  Student makes significant meaningful contributions to the project, on par with those of their teammates.  Student makes an impressive and outsized contribution to the project, from either a coding or expertise/vision perspective.
